			<h1>Sustainability Commitment</h1>

			<section>
				<h2>Understanding AI Uses Energy</h2>
				<p>
					We know that using artificial intelligence (AI) and large language
					models uses a lot of energy.<br />This requires powerful computers,
					which can harm the environment.
				</p>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h2>Minimizing AI Impact</h2>
				<p>We are using smaller AI models that are less harmful to the environment.<br /> This means we choose
					models that use less computer power and energy.<br /> Also, we keep our AI models in data centers
					that are in the most carbon-efficient areas.<br /> By doing this, we hope to lower our impact on the
					environment.</p>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h2>Using AI to Benefit Society</h2>
				<p>
					We use AI to help people.<br />We hope the positive outcome balances
					the negative impact on environment.
				</p>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h2>Promoting Responsible Use</h2>
				<p>
					We encourage everyone to use our platform responsibly.<br />By
					promoting careful use, we hope to lower unnecessary energy use and cut
					down our carbon footprint.
				</p>

			<section>
				<h2>Offsetting Carbon Emissions</h2>
				<p>
					We understand that our actions alone may not be enough.<br />So, we
					are committed to compensating for the carbon emissions our platform
					creates.<br />We will offset each request up to 10 grams of
					CO²-equivalent, through various environmental projects.<br />
					To learn more, see <a href="/en/content/blog/">our blog on our ecological actions</a>.

				<p>
					We are committed to sustainability and will keep working on improving
					our practices.
