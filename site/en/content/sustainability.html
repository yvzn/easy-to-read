			<h1>Sustainability Commitment</h1>

			<section>
				<h2>Understanding AI Uses Energy</h2>
				<p>
					We know that using artificial intelligence (AI) and large language
					models uses a lot of energy.<br />This requires powerful computers,
					which can harm the environment.
				</p>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h2>Working with Microsoft</h2>
				<p>
					To reduce this impact, we use data centers from Microsoft.<br /><a
						href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2020/01/16/microsoft-will-be-carbon-negative-by-2030/">Microsoft
						aims to be carbon neutral by 2030</a>.<br />This means they want to balance the amount of carbon
					they produce with actions that remove or reduce carbon-dioxide emissions.<br />
					Carbon-dioxide is a greenhouse gas harmful to the environment.<br />We hope they can achieve that
					very ambitious goal.
				</p>

			<section>
				<h2>Minimizing AI Impact</h2>
				<p>We are using smaller AI models that are less harmful to the environment.<br /> This means we choose
					models that use less computer power and energy.<br /> Also, we keep our AI models in data centers
					that are in the most carbon-efficient areas.<br /> By doing this, we hope to lower our impact on the
					environment even more.</p>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h2>Using AI to Benefit Society</h2>
				<p>
					We use AI to help people.<br />We hope the positive outcome balances
					the negative impact on environment.
				</p>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h2>Promoting Responsible Use</h2>
				<p>
					We encourage everyone to use our platform responsibly.<br />By
					promoting careful use, we hope to lower unnecessary energy use and cut
					down our carbon footprint.
				</p>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h2>Offsetting Carbon Emissions</h2>
				<p>
					We understand that our actions alone may not be enough.<br />So, we
					are committed to compensating for the carbon emissions our platform
					creates.<br />We will offset each request up to 10 grams of
					COÂ²-equivalent, through various environmental projects.
				</p>

				<p>
					We are committed to sustainability and will keep working on improving
					our practices.
