        <h2>Text Analysis</h2>
        <p>
          EasyRead.me looks at your text using smart technology.<br />
          It finds words that are hard to understand, long sentences, and
          difficult terms.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Simplification Process</h2>
        <p>When the analysis is done, we use a large language model to:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Replace hard words with easier ones</li>
          <li>Break long sentences into shorter ones</li>
          <li>Explain difficult terms in simple words</li>
          <li>Keep the original meaning while making it easier to read</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Checking for Improvement</h2>
        <p>Finally, we check each simplified text for:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Improvements in readability</li>
          <li>Order of information</li>
        </ul>
